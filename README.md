<strong>Use the cross-validation method to choose the best values of hyperparameters. </strong>

<strong> </strong>

<strong>Report should include the following  for each classifier and for each dataset</strong>:

<ol>

 <li>Table of classification accuracies of the model on training data and validation data for different values of hyperparameter</li>

 <li>Classification accuracy of the best configuration of the model on test data</li>

 <li>Confusion matrix for the best configuration of the model, on training data and test data 4.  Decision region plots for the best configuration of the model, for Datasets 1(a) and 1(b)<strong>.</strong> Superpose the training data on the decision region plot. For the Bayes classifiers using Gaussian distributions or GMMs, superpose the plots of level curves on the training data.</li>

</ol>




<strong>Report should also include your observations about the performance and the nature of decision surface for each classifier, and for each dataset. </strong>
